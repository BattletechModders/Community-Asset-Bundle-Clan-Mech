# Community Asset Bundle - Clan Mech

The Community Asset Bundles (CAB) are varied collections of 3D models, Unity asset bundles, and configurations for the HBS BattleTech 2018 game. They are a mod developers resource that provide no benefit on their own, and end-users have no reason to download or interact with them unless instructed to do so. Mod developers can use them to include new models into the game, if they understand how assets are loaded by the game.

## Contents

*Community Asset Bundle - Clan Mech* contains models of Clan BattleMechs across all time periods. This includes OmniMechs, second line units, and any refits of pure clan heritage. Mechs of Star League ancestry will be found in the base game or as part of CAB-IS Mech.

The list of available units changes over time; look in /assetbundles/ directory for a comprehensive list. 

Some models include the modeler's name in the assetbundle name. `chrprfmech_iononangerbase-001` is the Onanger model, created by IonRaptor.


## Usage
Models within the CABs have been donated by various modelers to the community **for use as a unified resource only**. You may not extract, copy, or distribute the models within any of the CABs without integrating with the CAB directly. This means your users must download the CAB repository directly from their own machine. 

You may not use the CAB models for 3D printing, even for individual use. 

You may not use the CAB models for any other game. If you want to use them in another Battletech themed game, make a Custom License Request below.

No support is given for the CAB. It's expected that you understand how these systems work already.

## Custom License Requests

As stated above, the models in the CAB are provided to the community as a unified resource. Some models within were released by their modeler under a more permissive license. If you'd like to redistribute models from the CAB in a more limited fashion, please go to one of the following discords and make a 'CAB Custom License Request':
